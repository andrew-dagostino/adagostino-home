                        I chose CaseWare for my first co-op placement because I had prior experience with the languages used
                        (C#, Java, C++) and was interested in seeing Agile and Scrum methodologies in action.

                        Going into my co-op at CaseWare, I set goals to improve my oral presentations, documentation, knowledge of Agile,
                        and knowledge of JavaScript.

                                    During this co-op I wanted to improve my software demonstrations and learn to write professional documentation.
                                    By doing so, I hoped to improve my written and oral communication skills, as well as learn about presenting software.

                                    Throughout my co-op, I documented and demonstrated several tasks I worked on during sprints. A couple examples I worked
                                    on are the <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> test and Data Services getting started guide.

                                    For the ESLint test I wrote, I made sure to document the configuration I used for it, as well as useful information
                                    and links to relevant documentations. For the getting started guide, I attended some of the Data Services team's
                                    meetings on the product to get a better understanding of it. I then worked with them in a Google Doc when writing it to
                                    get feedback and make improvements.

                                    As part of my Software Engineering degree I have taken several Software Design courses and this co-op placement was a
                                    chance to put what I learned into practice, and extend my learning.

                                    As a member of my squad, I took part in daily standup meetings and other Scrum ceremonies, including Sprint
                                    Planning/Review/Retrospective and Backlog Refinement. For some of our Backlog Refinements, we used
                                    <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker">planning poker</a> to estimate stories.

                                    Additionally, outside of my squad I attended sessions hosted by our Agile Practice Manager at CaseWare. These included
                                    Lean Coffees to discuss how Agile is being used in the company, Agile games to learn topics such as work in progress
                                    limits or Agile metrics like velocity. Some of the games we played were <a href="https://www.playspaceteam.com/">Spaceteam</a>

                                    In one of the last courses I took before going on co-op, <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2018-2019/courses/cis2750.shtml">CIS*2750</a>,
                                    we touched on a little bit of JavaScript, but I wanted to learn more, especially since it is a widely used language.
                                </p>
                                <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                                    In fact, JavaScript ended up being the primary language I used during my co-op. In particular, I wrote tests using
                                    <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> for our development
                                    pipeline. As mentioned earlier, one of those tests was to integrate the ESLint code quality linter, but I also worked
                                    on others, such as sanity tests for repository file encodings or repository naming.

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        I found my demo, JavaScript, and documentation goals to be a success. There were many tasks I completed
                        which helped me improve each of them, and they all were major components of my Map Gadget Capstone Project
                        (mentioned in the <a href="#job-description">Job Description</a> below).
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
                        If I were to rank my goals by success, it would be as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Demonstrations</li>
                            <li>Documentation</li>
                            <li>Agile</li>

                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        While I learned a lot about Agile, and would consider it a success, I didn't make the goal specific enough
                        to give a measure of success. I also originally had a goal to improve communication and coordination but it
                        was also very vague and partially covered by the demo and documentation goals. In future I will make sure my
                        goals are specific and easy to measure when I am choosing them.
