                        I chose CaseWare for my first co-op placement because I had prior experience with the languages used
                        (C#, Java, C++) and was interested in seeing Agile and Scrum methodologies in action.

                                    During this co-op I wanted to improve my software demonstrations and learn to write professional documentation.
                                    By doing so, I hoped to improve my written and oral communication skills, as well as learn about presenting software.

                                    Throughout my co-op, I documented and demonstrated several tasks I worked on during sprints. A couple examples I worked
                                    on are the <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> test and Data Services getting started guide.

                                    For the ESLint test I wrote, I made sure to document the configuration I used for it, as well as useful information
                                    and links to relevant documentations. For the getting started guide, I attended some of the Data Services team's
                                    meetings on the product to get a better understanding of it. I then worked with them in a Google Doc when writing it to
                                    get feedback and make improvements.

                                    Planning/Review/Retrospective and Backlog Refinement. For some of our Backlog Refinements, we used

                                    we touched on a little bit of JavaScript, but I wanted to learn more, especially since it is a widely used language.

                                    In fact, JavaScript ended up being the primary language I used during my co-op. In particular, I wrote tests using
                                    <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> for our development
                                    pipeline. As mentioned earlier, one of those tests was to integrate the ESLint code quality linter, but I also worked
                                    on others, such as sanity tests for repository file encodings or repository naming.

                        I found my demo, JavaScript, and documentation goals to be a success. There were many tasks I completed
                        which helped me improve each of them, and they all were major components of my Map Gadget Capstone Project
                        (mentioned in the <a href="#job-description">Job Description</a> below).
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
                        If I were to rank my goals by success, it would be as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>

                        While I learned a lot about Agile, and would consider it a success, I didn't make the goal specific enough
                        to give a measure of success. I also originally had a goal to improve communication and coordination but it
                        was also very vague and partially covered by the demo and documentation goals. In future I will make sure my
                        goals are specific and easy to measure when I am choosing them.

                        In my co-op I was a member of the Third Party Solutions squad. My job involved a mixture of developer support, code
                        management, and product development.

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        One of my squad's primary responsibilities was to assist Distributors from around the world with developing products on
                        CaseWare's platform.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        One of the most common tasks was to manage the set of almost 200 repositories where each Distributor stored their product(s)
                        code. When I was designated as on-call for the sprint, I would regularly check for incoming pull-requests, review them, and
                        then merge or comment back to the requester.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        Additionally, when Distributors wanted to release their product, I would set up pull-requests to move their code from develop
                        to release and then from release to master.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        Another common task when on-call would be to handle incoming JIRA tickets from Distributors. They could include questions,
                        bugs, requests, etc. For the questions and bugs, I would research the issue and then either answer the question, direct them
                        to documentation or sample code, or pass the ticket on to the relevant platform/product team for them to give a more direct
                        answer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        Finally, we did product development with the aim of making it easy to use the CaseWare platform. Some of the development was
                        to create sample code to help Distributors get started with the platform but we also created APIs/SDKs to make it easier to

                        One of the big projects I joined into was our Java <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> Microservice Framework. The end
                        goal was to provide a <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>/<a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> dependency that
                        Distributors could use to easily develop their own microservices that integrate with CaseWare Cloud. My part in the project
                        involved some refactoring of existing code as well as creating several unit tests using <a href="https://junit.org/junit4/">JUnit</a>
                        and <a href="https://site.mockito.org/">Mockito</a>.

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        As a capstone for my co-op term, and one of the big measures of success for my goals, I was given a project to create a JavaScript
                        gadget as sample code for creating gadgets and dashboards. The gadget would visualize overdue client requests for a firm on a bubble
                        map; similar to <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/">this one for the United States</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        My first step was to sit down with my Development Lead and break down the epic into individual stories. I then took the stories to a
                        story splitting session hosted by my Agile Practice Manager, where she provided feedback and helped me refine the stories.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        I then provided estimates for the stories and had some start being added to my squad's bi-weekly sprints for me to work on. At each
                        Sprint Review, I demoed the current state of the gadget. Once I had completed all the stories, I held a meeting for my squad to demo
                        the nearly complete gadget and obtain some feedback, which I worked on for the last few days of my co-op.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        The implementation of the project itself included using a mixture of browser JavaScript, the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>
                        map library, and CaseWare's own JavaScript libraries. It also involved using the <a href="https://opencagedata.com/">OpenCageData</a> geocoding
                        service, after completing some research into what services were available.

                        ​Alongside the gadget, I was also generating documentation to add to or improve the existing set. This included basic info on how to
                        get started using the map as well as documentation on the various CaseWare APIs that I used in creating my gadget. Additionally, I
                        reviewed and provided feedback on the existing documentation I went through, to find areas that could be improved or needed to be updated.

                        One of the more important pieces of knowledge I needed was knowledge of platform itself. I learned it through a combination
                        of onboarding documentation, code samples we provide to Distributors, and API documentation (as well as first-hand experience
                        using the APIs).
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        Another piece of information that helped with understanding terminology was basic knowledge of accounting/auditing. CaseWare
                        provided this in a two-day Auditing/Accounting 101 session, and helped with understanding and communicating with Distributors
                        and Clients.

                        For programming languages, the primary ones I used were Java and JavaScript. I had learned Java and some JavaScript previously
                        in the Object-Oriented Programming and Software Systems Development and Integration classes, but also learned more as I worked
                        with them.

                        For my first work term, I found the experience a little different then I expected. In terms of work, there was less programming than
                        I thought there would be and more process required for creating JIRA tickets to track work. Learning JavaScript was one of my goals
                        and definitely one of the major topics I learned about this work term. From learning based on ESLint's rules to writing Node.js and
                        Jasmine tests, to creating the map gadget.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        Another thing that I had not expected to learn going into the co-op was code management. Helping to manage almost 200 repositories
                        as a member of my squad lead me to learn a lot about the need for standardization, from naming conventions to repository organization.
                        Additionally, it made me more familiar with technologies such as git, NPM, and Gradle.
                    </p>

                    <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                        One of my favourite things about working at CaseWare was the variety of technologies I was exposed to, from Docker to Java Spring to
                        various JavaScript libraries like Jasmine and Leaflet.js. There was also many, knowledgeable people working there who would host Lunch
                        and Learns on topics like GraphQL, Kubernetes, and more. I took part in my own team's Lunch and Learn on our experience developing
                        microservices, where I demoed a Docker Compose file I was working on to run a microservice with the ElasticSearch, FluentD, Kibana stack.

                        Altogether I found it a valuable experience to know what the industry is like from a firsthand perspective. I enjoyed my time at CaseWare
                        and would be glad to return for my next co-op.
