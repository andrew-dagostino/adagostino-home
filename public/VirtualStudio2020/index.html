                                        My first goal was to become confident and gain experience creating database queries and working with databases
                                        in general.

                                        For the project I was working on for the duration of the work term, we were using the PostgreSQL database
                                        system. I actively took part in discussions covering the design of tables and relationships between tables
                                        while developing features.
                                    </p>

                                        I also made use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/">psycopg2</a> adapter to connect to the
                                        database from the server in order to perform a variety of queries including insertions, updates, retrievals,
                                        and deletions. Additionally, as part of the session management and registration, I worked with the in-memory

                                        Prior to lockdown, we would travel to the client’s business once every few weeks for an in-person meeting.
                                        However, with the changes brought about by COVID-19 and the need to socially distance, we ended up shifting to
                                        entirely online meetings, using Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams. These meetings initially were a once or
                                        twice a week tech update and demo meeting as well as a planning meeting for the following week.

                                        Additionally, there were numerous impromptu meetings, including ones to discuss the implementation of a
                                        feature with other developers, ones to get more details of a bug from our clients, and meetings to review
                                        security findings. Further communication was achieved using WhatsApp for quick messages and email to send
                                        mock-ups of planned features.

                        <p class="light blue-grey-text text-darken-4 indent-text">
                            Initially, my primary focus had been on the project’s UI development where I was the main developer. This gave me a strong
                            understanding of how the UI worked and any decisions/changes that went into its creation. As I began to focus more on
                            backend and database development, my overall understanding of the system grew, and I was able to apply knowledge from the
                            CIS*3530 databases course I had taken the previous semester towards the design and implementation of tables, and the
                            server APIs to interact with them.

                            Finally, the set of libraries I had personally researched as well as the ones I was able to work with further expanded the
                            toolset of libraries I am familiar with and that could be used in future projects.

                            For my co-op, I was part of a 2-person teaming working on developing a new web application for a client. We would also
                            coordinate with co-op students from the University of Waterloo who worked directly for the client. My initial focus was
                            entirely on the UI development, but I gradually assumed more of a full-stack role, working on the UI, server APIs, and
                            database.

                            One area where I was able to further expand my development skills was database development. After having done basic
                            database work in CIS*21000 and my previous co-op term, as well as more intermediate work in the CIS*3530 databases course,
                            I was able to fully test and expand upon my database experience.

                            Additionally, having been one of the two starting developers for the project, I had a strong knowledge of the overall
                            system, particularly the UI. This sometimes put me towards more of a leadership position, where some of the new co-ops
                            working for the client would come to me or my teammate for advice or review their code. Further, in planning meetings, I
                            had a prominent role in voicing my thoughts on upcoming changes as well as making suggestions of my own.

                            Having worked at JRS Virtual Studio my previous co-op work term, it was easy to get back into the swing of things when I
                            returned. I was able to immediately begin applying lessons I had learned while in my academic semester and was also able
                            to continue to expand my skillset. Due to my hard work and strong knowledge of the system, I will be continuing to work
                            with our client part-time during the following academic semester.
